Smart Spend
Turning spending data into smarter card decisions

SpendWise AI is a personal finance analytics and recommendation system that analyzes transaction-level credit card data to generate actionable insights and optimize cashback and savings. The project transforms raw financial data into structured analytics, detects spending anomalies, and recommends the best credit card for each purchase based on historical reward behavior.

The system includes monthly and yearly spending analysis by card and category, anomaly detection for inconsistent spending and subscription spikes, store-wise spending breakdowns per card, and a rule-based recommender that maximizes expected cashback while respecting credit and merchant limits. A lightweight chatbot interface enables users to query their spending patterns and receive recommendations through natural language instead of static dashboards.

This project emphasizes correctness and transparency by separating analytical logic from conversational layers, avoiding black-box AI for numerical decisions. Built as a modular, extensible system, SpendWise AI demonstrates practical applications of data analytics, recommendation logic, and conversational interfaces for real-world personal finance use cases.
